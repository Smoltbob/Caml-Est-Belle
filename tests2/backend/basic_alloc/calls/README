In this tests we check the external function calls.
We have several types of external function calls.

- no parameters and no return value
- a return value
- less than 5 parameters (we put them in registers r0 -> r3)
- more than 4 parameters (we have to put the rest in the stack) - Not implemented right now.

NB : we are expecting an error from simple_arr.asml.
